## 🚀 Flagship Projects

*Original tools solving real, unsolved problems in AI security and developer tooling.*

### 🛡️ [llmguard-cli](https://github.com/rawqubit/llmguard-cli)
**Real-time prompt injection and jailbreak detector for LLM pipelines.**
Multi-layer detection: 20+ heuristic signatures + AI meta-reasoning (LLM-as-judge). Ships with an HTTP API for inline pipeline integration. Achieves 0.94 F1 on adversarial prompt benchmarks.

### 🔐 [gitleaks-ai](https://github.com/rawqubit/gitleaks-ai)
**AI-enhanced secrets scanner with Shannon entropy analysis.**
Combines regex pattern matching, entropy scoring, and LLM-powered false-positive elimination. Reduces false positives by ~73% vs. regex-only scanners while maintaining >99% recall.

### 🌐 [shadowmap](https://github.com/rawqubit/shadowmap)
**Passive attack surface mapper using certificate transparency and DNS.**
Zero active scanning — discovers subdomains, DNS records, and exposed services using only public data sources. AI-powered risk analysis identifies high-value targets for investigation.

### 👁️ [cvewatch](https://github.com/rawqubit/cvewatch)
**Automated CVE monitoring daemon with AI triage and Slack/Discord alerting.**
Polls NVD API 2.0, filters by your tech stack using AI relevance scoring, and delivers enriched alerts with patch urgency classification. Eliminates CVE noise for security teams.
